"The Thue-Morse sequence is a binary sequence (of 0s and 1s) that never repeats. It is obtained by starting with 0 and successively calculating the Boolean complement of the sequence so far. It turns out that doing this yields an infinite, non-repeating sequence. This procedure yields 0 then 01, 0110, 01101001, 0110100110010110, and so on."
